# ELK Audio OS v1.0 notes

With ELK Audio OS v1.0 we switched from Xenomai 3 to Xenomai 4, also called EVL.

EVL is a major addition to the ELK Audio OS, and provides improved performance, scalability and ease of maintenance, across all supported platforms.

With ELK audio OS v1.0 there are also other major updates, including:

* Simplified Yocto build process by the use of [KAS tool](https://github.com/siemens/kas).

* Yocto layers updated to kirkstone release.

In order to simplify the whole image build starting from source code we also provide:

1. [ELK Audio OS builder](https://github.com/elk-audio/elk-audio-os-builder) docker image.

2. Ready to use [KAS configurations](https://github.com/elk-audio/kas-configs) for the supported boards.

As part of the transition from Xenomai 3 to EVL, we no longer support the Elk Pi hardware, due to the legacy drivers it requires.
The ‘sensei’ application is also no longer included, as it too depended on legacy driver features.
