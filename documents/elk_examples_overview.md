# Examples Overview
Since Elk Audio OS v1.0 all the examples are bundled with sushi and can be downloaded from the [public sushi repository](https://github.com/elk-audio/sushi).
Examples can be found under the `misc/config_files` folder.

Not all the examples will work for a specific board since they may need some extra audio channel or CV input but they are really good in showing all of the sushi features.

Some of the examples that are fully working on the Raspberry Pi are already provided in the target filesystem under `/home/mind/config_files` so they are immediately available for testing.

## GUI control app
TODO: should we provide any documentation there?
